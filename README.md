I am sure attribution for any derivative works of code from here (or anywhere) is generally greatly appreciated, including here :]

I did most of my learning from Dr. Andy Thomas' "Adventures in Machine Learning" blog. Sadly, it has since gone offline. That said, I've found some recent archived webpages here:
