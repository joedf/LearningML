I am sure attribution for any derivative works of code from here (or anywhere) is generally greatly appreciated, including here :]

I did most of my learning from Dr. Andy Thomas' "Adventures in Machine Learning" blog. Sadly, it has since gone offline. That said, I've found some archived webpages. I found 2022 versions, but I find the 2018 ones to be easier to read. The mathematical notation also seems to render better.
